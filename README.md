# openjdk-minimal-jre

This docker image is a standalone minimal openjdk JRE suitable to run most spring boot applications.

The image does not contain anything else as glibc and the java jre. Java is installed in /jre.

The details can be found in my (german) blog post at https://www.cologne-intelligence.de/blog/detail/show/kleine-jres-mit-openjdk-13-erstellen/
